Portfolio Website to display my skills and some of the projects that I have worked on.
The projects page shows the cards for each project, and more information can be seen if you click anywhere on the card (outside of the site/source code buttons)
I can be contacted via email through the form on the contact page.

Potential Issues:
I am aware of a scaling image with the Home section profile picture on Safari. The main issue has been resolved, however the responsiveness is less aesthetic than on Firefox, Chrome, and Edge.
Python and Java logos have not been coloured in the skill section as they are not monotone and only one colour can be applied in the current implementation.
